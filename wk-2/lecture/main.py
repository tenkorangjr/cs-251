Notes:

Data visualization can mislead us. Sometimes humans find patterns when there are none! 

Mischaracterisation of data can be misleading. Be sure to label x-axis and y-axis appropriately.
Keep representations simple: Just one variable on each axis.
Avoid 3D plots since they are vague and it's hard for humans to read 3D plots on 2D screens. Thus, the angle of perspective affects our view of the value.
Careful selection and omission of data can also cause misrepresentations of data.

NUMPY:
Python stores elements in a list as object references while numpy stores it as contiguous in memory.
